# How to use the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X with Nimiq

## What is a Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X?

The [Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) and
[Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) are so called hardware wallets. A hardware wallet is a very secure and at the same time user friendly way to access your funds as the private key to your funds is stored on the hardware wallet device itself and doesn't get leaked. Your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page. If you're holding cryptocurrency worth more than a week's salary we **highly** recommend to get a hardware wallet. It's worth it.

We provide an official Nimiq app for Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X devices to manage NIM with the [Nimiq Safe](https://safe.nimiq.com/) application.
